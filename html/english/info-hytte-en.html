								<h3>BOATING AND FISHING OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
									<p>Try your luck fishing! There are a lot of fish around Flekkerøya, especially it is easy to catch Mackerel, Cod, Saithe and Lyr. It can be fished both from land or boat. Complete fishing equipment can be found in the holiday home.</p>
									<p>The holiday home has its own berth, and this can be used. Please contact us if this is desired. Boat is not available. When renting an external boat: This must be under 20 feet to fit in the berth. The drawing below shows the various berths on the pier, and the holiday home has boat space no. 1. Other external boats and kayaks must not be used/ touched, as these are owned by other cabins.</p>
